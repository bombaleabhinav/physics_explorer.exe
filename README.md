# 🔬 Physics Concept Explorer - Visual Simulator

---

## 📋 Project Overview

A modular Physics simulation system split into separate functional components. The project emphasizes visual feedback through ASCII animations/graphs and other visual ways.

## Features

1.  **Modular Design**: Every physics concept has its own `.c` file.
2.  **No Header Files**: Prototypes are used directly in `main.c` for linking.
3.  **UI/UX**:
    *   **ANSI Colors**: Vivid Cyan, Green, Yellow, and Red highlights.
    *   **Animations**: Loading dots and clear transitions.
    *   **ASCII Art**: Trajectory graphs, step waves, and circuit diagrams.
4.  **Optimized Ohm's Law**: Focused specifically on Series and Parallel resistor networks as requested.

## Summary of Modules

*   **Projectile**: Calculates range, height, and time with a 2D plot.
*   **Resistors**: Handles $N$ resistors in series or parallel configurations.
*   **SHM**: Displays a scrolling sine wave based on user-defined amplitude/frequency.
*   **Waves**: Shows constructive/destructive interference between two user-defined waves.
*   **Optics**: Calculates refraction angles and detects total internal reflection cases.
